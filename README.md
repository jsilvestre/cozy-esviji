This game came out of my mind 20 years ago thanks to the great platform that were [HP 48 calculators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-48_series) (I've had 3 of them). I loved playing Puzzle Bobble, Tetris and other casual game on my HP, but was also eager to develop my own game (a sily habit I have to develop games to discover new platforms/languages), and came with this idea of a kind of mashup of Puzzle Bobble and other games.

I never found a satisfying name for this game, so I now took "esviji", a word game on "SVG", the technology used for its development.
